libhydrogen
===========

The Hydrogen library is a small, easy-to-use, hard-to-misuse cryptographic
library for constrained environements.

It provides a consistent high-level API for common operations, and the
whole code is licensed under the very liberal 2-clauses BSD license.

This is a work in progress (mainly targeting Arduino boards for now) --
Do not use yet. It isn't supposed to work *at all*.
